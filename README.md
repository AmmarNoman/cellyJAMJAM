Hi there. I found [this](http://www.electroschematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cell-phone-jammer-schematic.gif) cell phone jammer on the internet. It is for the GSM 1900 spectrum. Many of these parts are legacy and I had to use replacements. If you look at the actual schematic in Eagle, I've noted the new name of each part. Feel free to email me with questions: allison//at//allisonburtch.net
